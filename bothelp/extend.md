The "Extend" feature of Smart! is a way of taking a configured structure and creating a duplicate structure immediately next to it.  In addition to the new building, the settings, belts, and mergers/splitters are added so that the new building has everything except power ready to go.  At this time, fluids are not supported.

To use the "Extend" feature:

1) Select with your build tool the type of structure you wish to extend.  **This is most easily accomplished by pressing the middle mouse button on the building you are targeting**
2) Point at the building you wish to extend.  You will notice that a hologram of the building will appear next to it with the proposed belts and connectors attached.
3) Use the mouse-wheel to toggle between the left and right side of the target building.
4) Click the left-click to accept the proposed building, and watch the magic!

Notes:

* Extend will only extend a single building at a time.  If you attempt to do more, you will see that the connectors vanish, and the settings will not move to  any of the new buildings
* Extend does not currently support fluid connectors, so pipes and fittings are not copied.
* Extend expects the buildings to be set up to move items down a line.  As a result, using a splitter that has its input either towards or away from the building will not extend.  Nor will a merger with its output pointing towards or away from the building.  This is because you would not be able to put a valid belt between those splitters and mergers oriented that way.
