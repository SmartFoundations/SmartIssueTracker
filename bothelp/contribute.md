Can I contribute to the development of Smart! code?

This particular mod is unique in that it was developed with C++, with a good understanding of the Unreal Engine, and is the products of hundreds of hours of experimentation. Unless you have, yourself, written a mod in UE for Satisfactory, C++, and have experience with complicated functions of games, getting you up to speed is probably a ton of effort.

For ideas for enhancements, submit feature requests, and they will be evaluated based on difficulty and interest of the developer.  (Type !FeatureRequest for more information)

An easy way to support development is to thank the developer, Alex. It is nice when a passion project is appreciated!

If you really want to contribute to the developer because you found a lot of personal value in the mod, please consider subscribing to the Patreon site.  There are different levels of subscriptions that can allow you to express your appreciation for the mod and its continued support.
