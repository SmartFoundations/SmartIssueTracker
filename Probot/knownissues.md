Current known issues, limitations, and workarounds for Smart! v22:

--Known Issues--

**Multiplayer** ⚠️ Limited - Not fully supported. Use single-player mode. See !multiplayer

**Resource Extractors** ⚠️ Limited - Scaling disabled (intentional). Place individually.

**Water Extractors** ⚠️ Limited - Scaling disabled (intentional). Place manually.

**Auto-Connect** 🚧 In Development - Not implemented. Manual connection required. Planned for Phase 2.

**Large Grids** ⚠️ Minor - Very large grids (100+) may impact performance. Use smaller grids or increase spacing.

--Limitations--

**Building Type Support:** Not all building types support all features. Resource extractors have scaling disabled. Some buildings have type-specific limitations.

**Grid Size Limits:** Maximum grid size varies by building type. Very large grids may hit game engine limits. Server validation may reject extremely large grids.

**Multiplayer Replication:** Some features may not replicate correctly. Host has full functionality; clients may experience limitations.

--Quick Workarounds--

**Scaling doesn't work?** Check if building supports scaling, verify keybinds are configured correctly.

**Spacing doesn't apply?** Verify spacing mode enabled (hold **;**), check counters, ensure correct axis.

**HUD doesn't display?** Verify mod loaded, check for UI conflicts, review logs.
