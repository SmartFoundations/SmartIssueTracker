Submit bug reports at the Smart! GitHub repository. Before reporting, check !knownissues to see if your issue is already known.

**GitHub Issues:** <https://github.com/SmartFoundations/SmartIssueTracker/issues>

--Before Reporting--

**Important:** Try removing other mods to isolate the issue to Smart! This helps determine if it's a mod conflict or a Smart! issue.

**Check First:** Read through existing issues to make sure your bug hasn't already been reported. If a similar issue exists, add your observations to that thread instead of creating a duplicate.

--How to Report--

1. **Create/Login to GitHub** - You'll need a GitHub account (free and quick).

2. **Go to Issues Page** - Visit link above, click green "New Issue" button.

3. **Select Bug Report** - Click "Get Started" next to "Bug report" option.

4. **Enter Title** - Short but descriptive so others understand the bug from title.

5. **Fill Out Template** - Template will appear. Clear example text and fill in:
   - **Steps to reproduce** (CRITICAL - exact steps)
   - **Expected vs Actual behavior**
   - **Version info:** Smart! version, game version, SML version
   - **Mod list:** Other mods (if any)
   - **Hardware:** Relevant hardware info
   - **Images/Screenshots:** Paste directly (auto-uploads)

6. **Preview** - Click "Preview" tab to review before submitting.

7. **Submit** - Click "Submit" to post your bug report.
