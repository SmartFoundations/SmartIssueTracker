Extend is planned for re-release in Phase 3 (Smart! v24). Version 23 focuses on the new auto-connect systems that Extend will build on top of.

Extend takes a configured factory building and creates a 1:1 clone of that building and its item flow, next to the original. The new building is placed, configured, and wired with belts, lifts, pipes, and distributors so that, except for power, it behaves like another link in the same production line.

For each input/output on the target building, Extend walks the full chain to its distributor (lifts, belt/pipe segments, poles, and the final splitter/merger/distributor), then clones that chain and links the new distributors into a manifold so items keep flowing.

To use it: sample the building type (Smart sampling, e.g. middle mouse), make sure it is active on your build gun, aim at an existing copy, use the mouse wheel to choose which side to extend on, then left-click to place the clone.

Extend always works on one building at a time and does not power the clone. Use Satisfactory power tools or Smart! Power Auto-Connect to hook it into your power grid.
