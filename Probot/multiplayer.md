At this time, Smart! does not fully support multiplayer.

That said, you may find that some features do, in fact, work in multiplayer. Usually, you will have the most success if you are the host of the session.  Mods are not supported on dedicated servers at this time.

If something isn't working in multiplayer, you may be able to get partial functionality, but you may also have issues ranging from out of sync sessions between players, sessions crashing or dropping players.

Update: It has been reported that disabling the camera on a client machine (the person connecting to the host) can prevent some crashes. This may or may not solve some issues you might have in multiplayer. You can disable the camera from the Smart! menu while in a single player or host mode.

Multiplayer support is something that is certainly desired.  Coffee Stain is still actively working on the multiplayer and dedicated server aspects of the game, so things are still pretty fluid.
