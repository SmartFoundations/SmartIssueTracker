Steps mode creates vertical stairs and stepping patterns by progressively raising each item in your grid.

--How Steps Works--

Steps adds vertical elevation that increases with each item along the selected axis, creating a staircase effect. Different from spacing (gaps) or stagger (lateral offsets), steps only affects vertical height.

--Using Steps--

1. Scale out structures using !scaleobjects.

2. Hold **I** to activate Steps mode.

3. While holding **I**, use scroll wheel or **NumPad 8/5** to adjust step height. Positive = upward, negative = downward.

4. Press **Num0** (while holding **I**) to cycle axes:
   - **X** - Steps rise along X axis (width/rows)
   - **Y** - Steps rise along Y axis (depth/columns)

5. Release **I** to lock settings, then place structures.

--Steps Axes--

**X Axis:** Steps rise as grid extends along X. Each column progressively higher. Perfect for forward/backward ramps or staircases.

**Y Axis:** Steps rise as grid extends along Y. Each row progressively higher. Perfect for left/right ramps or staircases.

--Examples--

* **Foundation Staircase:** Scale 1x10x1 foundations, hold **I**, press **Num0** until "X", scroll for 0.5m steps = staircase!

* **Tiered Floor:** Scale 5x5x1 foundations, hold **I**, press **Num0** until "Y", scroll for 2m steps = tiered factory floor.

* **Ramp Access:** Combine X/Y scaling with Steps on one axis for diagonal ramps.

--Related Features--

* Combine with !spacing to add gaps between steps
* Use !stagger for diagonal patterns (different from steps' vertical rise)
* See !keybinds to customize controls
