Smart! v22 was developed with AI assistance. This disclosure addresses common questions and concerns.

--AI Usage Disclosure--

Smart! v22 is a complete rebuild by Finalomega for Satisfactory 1.1, developed with AI assistance (Claude, Codex, GPT-5 via Windsurf by Cognition). MCP server with vector database provided SML codebase and Alex's original Smart! source as context.

AI was used as a development tool for architecture, C++ implementation, debugging, performance optimization, Input system integration, documentation, and API migration. All implementation decisions, testing, and creative direction by Finalomega. AI used similar to IDEs/compilers - final responsibility remains with human developer.

--Code Ownership & Originality--

**Original Smart! (v1-v21):** Created by Alex through Satisfactory Early Access without AI assistance. All core concepts, features, and design were established before generative AI was publicly available.

**Smart! v22:** Ground-up rebuild by Finalomega with Alex's blessing and access to original source code. This is not code theft - it's continuation of an existing project with permission, using AI as a development tool to rebuild for Satisfactory 1.1.

--Ethical Considerations--

We acknowledge concerns about AI energy usage. We note that Satisfactory itself is graphics-intensive, and many development tools (compilers, IDEs, cloud services) consume resources. AI was used efficiently as a tool with human oversight. Transparency is important, which is why this disclosure exists.

--Policy Compliance--

No policy against AI usage for Satisfactory mods. This disclosure is voluntary for transparency. Discussion of AI usage is not permitted on Satisfactory Modding Discord servers, but the mod complies with all modding policies.
