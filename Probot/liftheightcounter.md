Lift Height Counter is planned for a future update (not available yet).

--Status--

📏 Planned (Not Yet Implemented)
- Target release: After Phase 2 (timing TBD)
- Track requests/issues: <https://github.com/SmartFoundations/SmartIssueTracker/issues>

--What It Will Do--

Display accurate height information while placing conveyor lifts:
- Height from the lift’s starting point (local height)
- Height from the world base level (global height)

The info will be shown directly on the HUD during lift placement so you can match heights consistently across your factory without manual measurement.

--Intended Use Cases--

- Aligning lift heights between floors
- Verifying exact vertical distances for standardized layouts
- Matching heights across different factory areas using world-base reference

* !scaleobjects, !spacing, !steps, !stagger — Build tools that benefit from precise heights
