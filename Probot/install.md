Install Smart! with Satisfactory Mod Manager (SMM).

--Quick Install--

1) Open SMM and search for "Smart!"
2) Select version:
   - **Latest** = Current stable release (recommended)
   - **-test** = Pre-release/testing builds (opt-in under Versions)
3) Click **Install** and launch the game

--Notes--

- Selecting **Latest** will not move you to a new test version; it only updates to new stable releases.
- If you previously installed an alpha/pre-release manually, launching SMM may overwrite it with the selected SMM version.
- For install help with SMM, see their guide: <https://ficsit.app/guide/3TfMWjmpRvjwLk>
