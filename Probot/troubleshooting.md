Having issues with Smart!? Try these troubleshooting steps in order:

--Step 1: Check Your Version--

Ensure you have the latest version of Smart! from Satisfactory Mod Manager (SMM). See !install for installation details. Make sure SMM is set to "Latest" version, not an older test version.

--Step 2: Test for Mod Conflicts--

If features aren't working, test by removing all other mods except Smart! Mod conflicts can occur since we can't test every mod combination. Isolating Smart! helps determine if it's a conflict or a Smart! issue.

--Step 3: Check Your Keybinds--

Buttons not working? Check your keybinds in **Main Menu > Options > Keybindings > Smart! Scaling Controls**. Verify all keybinds are set correctly. See !keybinds for default keybinds and customization help.

**Keybind Conflicts:** If Smart! keybinds conflict with base game or other mods, you can:
- Remap Smart! keybinds in Options > Keybindings > Smart! Scaling Controls
- Or remap the conflicting Satisfactory keybinds in the main keybindings menu

--Step 4: Check Known Issues--

See if others are experiencing similar issues. Check !knownissues for current known bugs and limitations. If your issue is listed, it's being tracked!

--Step 5: Review Feature Documentation--

Make sure you're using features correctly. See !scaleobjects, !spacing, !steps, !stagger, and !recipe for detailed usage.

--Step 6: Get Help--

Still stuck? Ask in **#help** Discord channel! Before asking, try !help to see available commands.

**Before Reporting Bugs:** See !bugreport for how to properly report issues. Include version info and steps to reproduce!
