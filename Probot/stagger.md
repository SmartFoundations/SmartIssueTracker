Stagger mode creates diagonal patterns and leaning tower effects by applying progressive offsets to your scaled grid.

--How Stagger Works--

Stagger applies lateral offset that increases with each item, creating curved/diagonal patterns. Different from spacing (gaps) or steps (vertical stairs).

--Using Stagger--

1. Scale out structures using !scaleobjects.

2. Hold **Y** to activate Stagger mode.

3. While holding **Y**, use scroll wheel or **NumPad 8/5** to adjust stagger. Positive = one direction, negative = opposite.

4. Press **Num0** (while holding **Y**) to cycle axes:
   - **X** - Horizontal diagonal (sideways offset along X)
   - **Y** - Horizontal diagonal (forward/back offset along Y)
   - **ZX** - Vertical lean (tower leans forward/back as it rises)
   - **ZY** - Vertical lean (tower leans sideways as it rises)

5. Release **Y** to lock settings, then place structures.

--Stagger Axes--

**X/Y (Horizontal Diagonals):** Diagonal patterns on ground plane. X = sideways offset, Y = forward/back offset. Great for curved paths.

**ZX/ZY (Vertical Lean):** Leaning tower effects as grid rises. ZX = forward/back lean, ZY = sideways lean. Perfect for architectural effects.

--Examples--

* **Diagonal Path:** Scale foundations in line, hold **Y**, press **Num0** until "X", scroll for curved path.

* **Leaning Tower:** Scale 1x1x10 foundations, hold **Y**, press **Num0** until "ZX", scroll for forward lean.

* **Splitter Staircase for Manufacturers:** Scale splitters vertically (1x1x4), hold **Y**, press **Num0** until "ZX", scroll to create stepping group. Then scale on X with !spacing on X for perfect staircase of splitters.

--Related Features--

* Combine with !spacing to add gaps to diagonal patterns
* Use !steps for vertical stepping (different from stagger's lean)
* See !keybinds to customize controls
