Smart! Development Roadmap and Status

--Status--

✅ Phase 1 (v22): Scaling, Spacing, Steps, Stagger, Recipe Mode
🚧 Phase 2: Auto-Connect (belts first, pipes follow-up)
🗓️ Phase 3: Extend (duplicate buildings + connections)
🕶️ Phase 4: Camera (may release as separate mod)

Planned (post-Phase 2+):
- Lift Height Counter (HUD readout: local + world-base height)
- Restore (preset/save of scaling/spacing)
- QoL: HUD options, keybind polish, more building support

--Priorities--

1) Solidify Phase 1 UX & stability (bugfixes, performance)
2) Implement Auto-Connect core (Phase 2)
3) Extend with connection copying (Phase 3)
4) Camera planning/preview (Phase 4)
5) Multiplayer behavior improvements and validation

--How You Can Influence Priorities--

- Vote or comment on issues/requests: <https://github.com/SmartFoundations/SmartIssueTracker/issues>
- Use !bugreport with clear steps to reproduce and versions
- Share use cases in Discord (#help / #showcase)

--Notes--

- Multiplayer is limited; feature behavior will be validated as phases progress (see !knownissues)
- Not all building types support all features yet; support expands over time
