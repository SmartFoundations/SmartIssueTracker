Recipe Selection mode lets you cycle through available recipes for buildings with multiple production options before placing them.

--How Recipe Selection Works--

When selecting a building with multiple recipes (Assemblers, Manufacturers, Refineries, Blenders, etc.), Recipe Selection mode lets you preview and choose which recipe to use. The HUD displays inputs and outputs for each recipe as you cycle.

--Using Recipe Selection--

1. Select a building with multiple recipes in the build menu.

2. Hold **U** to activate Recipe Selection mode.

3. While holding **U**, use scroll wheel or **NumPad 8/5** to cycle recipes:
   - **NumPad 8** or scroll up - Next recipe
   - **NumPad 5** or scroll down - Previous recipe

4. HUD displays current recipe's inputs/outputs as you cycle.

5. Release **U** to lock in your selection.

6. Continue with scaling, spacing, or other features. All buildings in your grid will use the selected recipe.

--Clearing Recipe Selection--

Press **Num0** while holding **U** to clear manual selection and return to default recipe.

--Recipe Copying--

When scaling buildings, Smart! automatically copies recipes to all buildings in your grid. Selected recipes are applied to all buildings - no need to configure each individually.

--Examples--

* **Manufacturing Setup:** Select Manufacturer, hold **U**, scroll to "Computer" recipe, release **U**. Scale 5x1x1 grid. All 5 produce Computers.

* **Refinery Planning:** Select Refinery, hold **U**, cycle through unlocked recipes. Choose recipe, then scale out setup.

* **Recipe Comparison:** Use Recipe Selection to compare recipes for same building type, checking inputs/outputs in HUD before building.
