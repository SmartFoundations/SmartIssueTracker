Spacing mode adds gaps between items in your scaled grid, spreading them to specific distances.

--How Spacing Works--

Spacing adds gaps between each item in your grid. Unlike scaling (creates more items) or stagger (creates offsets), spacing increases distance between items while keeping them aligned.

--Using Spacing--

1. Scale out structures using !scaleobjects.

2. Hold **;** (semicolon) to activate Spacing mode.

3. While holding **;**, use scroll wheel or **NumPad 8/5** to adjust spacing. Positive = gaps, negative = closer.

4. Press **Num0** (while holding **;**) to cycle axes:
   - **X** - Spacing along X axis (width/rows)
   - **Y** - Spacing along Y axis (depth/columns)
   - **Z** - Spacing along Z axis (height/layers)

5. Adjust multiple axes by cycling to each and adjusting independently.

6. Release **;** to lock settings, then place structures.

--Power Storage Example--

* Create 8x8 Power Storage grid with 2m spacing (centered on foundations).

* Use !scaleobjects to create 8x8 Power Storage holograms, positioned where you want.

* Hold **;**, press **Num0** until "X" axis, scroll/NumPad 8 to 2m spacing.

* Press **Num0** again for "Y" axis, scroll to 2m spacing.

* Release **;**, verify spacing, click to place. Wire up for beautiful evenly-spaced grid!

--Related Features--

* Combine with !stagger for diagonal patterns with gaps
* Use !steps for vertical stairs with spacing between levels
* See !keybinds to customize controls
