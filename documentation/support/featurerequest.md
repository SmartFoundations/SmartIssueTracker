Features can be requested at the Smart! GitHub repository.

Requirement: You must have a GitHub account, which is a pretty quick process. Follow the prompts to create an account if necessary, or log in with your existing account.

1) Read through the existing feature requests to make sure what you are wanting to request hasn't already been submitted.

If the feature request or something closely related to it is already submitted, you are encouraged to add your thoughts or enhancements to the thread.
Even just putting a comment like "I would like this too!" helps as it shows increased demand for the feature.

**Please read through existing features to see if what you are requesting has already been submitted.**

2) Press the green "New Issue" button in the top right of the page.

3) Select the "Get Started" next to the "Feature request" option.

4) On the submission page, you will need to enter a title.

**Please make this short but as descriptive as possible so that others can get an idea about the request from the title**

5) In the body of the request, a pre-populated template of text will be presented. Clear out example text, and insert your idea into each section. Images can be directly pasted into the text, where they will be uploaded.

**Not all concepts are easily expressed! Just do your best to get the idea across and perhaps others will jump in to help clarify and enhance your idea!**

6) Before submitting, click on the "Preview" tab at the top and make sure everything looks right.

7) Click on the Submit button to post your feature request.

**Note: Not all requests are possible to implement, and may be restricted by the Unreal Engine, Coffee Stain's Satisfactory code, or the developer may not have a good way to put it in. Further, not all ideas fall into scope of the goal of the Smart! mod. Developer interest in the idea may factor in, too.
