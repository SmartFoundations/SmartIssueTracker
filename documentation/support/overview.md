-- Smart! Overview --

Smart! is designed to make building your factory less tedious!  It does this by providing:

* Base game friendly enhancements to scale your builds!
* Automation to connect belts, splitters, mergers, etc. so you can focus on the grand vision and being efficient!
* Tools to help you accurately place your objects EXACTLY where you want them! (Counters, measurements, and cameras)
* Retaining balance by ensuring that by using these tools, you still have to pay resources as if you built everything manually.

-- What Smart! Doesn't Do --

Smart! does not alter saved games at all, nor make your saved games incompatible with the vanilla game.
What this means is that if you use Smart! to build your factory, but uninstall it later, the saved game will load just as if Smart! had not been installed.
This is because Smart! uses only methods for building objects that are used by the game itself, so there is no risk of ruining your saved games!

-- What is in scope for Smart! for the future? --

* Any fun feature requests (!featurerequest) that are in line with the sections above
* Crazy ideas that Alex comes up with!
* Bug fixes
* Who knows? Merch? Ice Cream flavors such as "Rocky Road Waffle Grid"? A city planning political run based on the principles of Smart!?
