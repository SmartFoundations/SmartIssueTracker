-- Smart! Overview --

Smart! is designed to make building your factory less tedious!  It does this by providing:

* Base game friendly enhancements to scale your builds!
* Automation to connect belts, splitters, mergers, etc. so you can focus on the grand vision and being efficient!
* Tools to help you accurately place your objects EXACTLY where you want them! (Counters, measurements, and cameras)
* Retaining balance by ensuring that by using these tools, you still have to pay resources as if you built everything manually.

-- What Smart! Doesn't Do --

Smart! does not facilitate cheating!

* Will not provide free resources for building.
* Will not create new inventory slots or change how inventory is managed outside of paying for builds.
* Will not provide buildings not available in the base game.
* No other super-powers outside be super-efficiency!

-- What is in scope for Smart! for the future? --

* Any fun feature requests (!featurerequest) that are in line with the sections above
* Crazy ideas that Alex comes up with!
* Bug fixes
* Who knows? Merch? Ice Cream flavors such as "Rocky Road Waffle Grid"? A city planning political run based on the principles of Smart!?
