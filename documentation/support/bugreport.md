Bug reports can be submitted at the Smart! GitHub repository.

**Before submitting a bug report, please try to remove other mods so that you can isolate the issue to Smart!**

Requirement: You must have a GitHub account, which is a pretty quick process. Follow the prompts to create an account if necessary, or log in with your existing account.

1) Read through the existing bugs to make sure what you are wanting to report hasn't already been submitted.

**If the bug or something closely related to it is already submitted, you are encouraged to add your thoughts or observations to the existing thread instead of creating a new issue.**

2) Press the green "New Issue" button in the top right of the page.

3) Select the "Get Started" next to the "Bug report" option.

4) On the submission page, you will need to enter a title.

**Please make this short but as descriptive as possible so that others can get an idea about the bug from the title**

5) In the body of the bug report, a pre-populated template of text will be presented. Clear out example text, and insert the bug details into each section. Images can be directly pasted into the text, where they will be uploaded. Steps to reproduce are critical so that Alex can address it.  Please also try to note anything that might be unique about your installation, mod list, mod version, game version, and maybe even hardware.

**Not all concepts are easily expressed! Just do your best to get the issue conveyed and perhaps others will jump in with additional details**

6) Before submitting, click on the "Preview" tab at the top and make sure everything looks right.

7) Click on the Submit button to post your bug report.

**Note: Not all bugs are possible to reproduce for the developer. It is really hard to analyze and test fixes if you can't see the bug.
