Installing Smart! is easy with Satisfactory Mod Manager (SMM).  Get the latest non-test version directly from the app and automatically installed!

To find a guide on how to install SMM, visit <https://ficsit.app/guide/3TfMWjmpRvjwLk>.  While Smart! is available on SMM, it does not support it directly.  Please forward any questions regarding installation and configuration to their Discord at <https://discord.com/invite/xkVJ73E>.

Once SMM is configured, search for the Smart! mod and click the download link.  Once downloaded, it will be available when you launch the game.

**Note**

If you have installed a test version of the game from Discord from Alex, launching SMM may overwrite or remove the test version and replace it with a version that SMM has available.
