Find pre-release updates in Discord before they are released to Satisfactory Mod Manager.

!!! URGENT !!!
For your safety, do not download or deploy any pre-releases except those posted by Alex in the #work-in-progress channel at <https://discord.com/channels/799091523173613589/840706876836544512>
If Alex didn't provide it, it isn't official and could have been tampered with!

To install the test version of the mod please unzip the content of the zip file to the Mods folder of the game.

The folder should be named "SmartFoundations" and not SmartFoundations-V18.x.x, or some other variation or all user interface components (counter and settings) will not work for you.

So the final path should look like "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Satisfactory\FactoryGame\Mods\SmartFoundations"
(This could vary depending on where you have your Steam library located.  Adjust as needed.)
