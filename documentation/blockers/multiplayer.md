At this time, Smart! does not support multiplayer.

That said, you may find that some features do, in fact, work in multiplayer. Usually, you will have the most success if you are the host of the session.

If something isn't working in multiplayer, you may be able to get partial functionality, but you may also have issues ranging from out of sync sessions between players, sessions crashing or dropping players, or even having a save corrupted.

Multiplayer support is something that is certainly desired.  Coffee Stain is still actively working on the multiplayer and dedicated server aspects of the game, so things are still pretty fluid.

To express interest in this feature, consider commenting on the GitHub feature requests (!featurerequest)
