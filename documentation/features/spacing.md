Spacing is the ability to place a number of scaled out structures spread out to specific distances.

Things that can be configured in settings:

--Using Spacing--

* Build a grouping of structures by scaling out a structure in the X, Y, and/or Z axes.
* Press the spacing button (P by default) and press the up and down arrows to select the spacing mode you wish to apply the spacing on.
* While holding the spacing button, use the mouse wheel to increase the spacing on the selected axes.
* If you need to change a different axis afterwards, you can again hold the P button and switch modes and changing the spacing in the new mode.
* Verify your spacing is what you expect, and place the structures.

--Power Storage Example--

* You wish to make an 8 x 8 grid of Power Storage units to store some power as a backup, but want each structure to be placed in the middle of the foundation..
* Using the scaling feature, create holograms of 8 x 8 Power Storage units, with the first unit in the middle of the foundation.
* Before placing the structures, press and hold the spacing button (P by default), and you will see the scaling mode.
* Since you want all the units to be spaced equally on the X and Y axis, press the up arrow button until you see the mode change to "X + Y"
* Then, while continuing to hold the P button, use the mouse wheel to increase spacing. In this example, you would increase the spacing by 2.
* Verify that the structures are where you expect them, and place them with a mouse click.
* Wire everything up, and you have a beautiful grid of power storage.
