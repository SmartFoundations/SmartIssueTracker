The Lift Height Counter helps guide your lifts to the perfect height.  Automatically shown when building a lift belt, you will find two numbers shown in meters.

The first number is the height relative to the starting point in either direction. This is used to nail the perfect length for your belts every time.

The second number is the height relative to the world map.  This is a shared height across the entire map.  If you place a belt at 100m on one side of the map, and 100m on the other side of the map, they will be the exact same height, and in theory you could run belts between them without any more lifts.
