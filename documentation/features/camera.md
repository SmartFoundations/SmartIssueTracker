This is a new feature currently only available in the pre-release version starting with 18.0.8 for Update 6.

The camera feature creates a small view-box in the upper left corner of the screen where you can see a foundation, lift, or other structure from the perspective of the furthest object.

Use cases:

1) While building 100+ foundations to link one base to another, you can use the new camera view-box to see when you have the foundation aligned with the base.
2) While using lifts, ensure that the lift is aligned with the input or output of a building in situations where you cannot get a good look at the other end.
3) Use as a periscope to see what might be on top of that hill before spending time to climb it.  Perhaps creatures or a crash site may be waiting!
