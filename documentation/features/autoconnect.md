--Description--

The "Auto-Connect" feature of Smart! gives you the ability to have belts placed on your behalf when placing a splitter or merger next to your production building. In the case of fluids, auto-connect will automatically connect the pipes to a production building when placing a Pipeline Junction Cross.

--Staggered Splitters-- 

In some cases where there are multiple inputs to a production building, you might have auto-connect suggest placement of splitters for each of the inputs, each as staggered heights to allow for clean belt-work.

--How do I stop auto-connect from applying the suggestion?--

In cases where you may not wish to use the suggested auto-connect, you may press the left-shift button twice very quickly, and you will be taken out of auto-connect mode until your next building attempt.
