## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What items can Smart! scale?
Smart! currently supports:
- **Foundations** - All foundation types and sizes
- **Production Buildings** - Constructors, assemblers, manufacturers, refineries, smelters, foundries, packagers, blenders, particle accelerators
- **Storage** - Storage containers (all tiers), fluid buffers, industrial fluid buffers
- **Walls** - Most wall types (standard, windows, gates)
- **Logistics** - Splitters, mergers (all tiers)
- **Power** - Power poles (all types)

### What items are NOT yet supported?
Items requiring multi-click or click-and-drag placement are not yet supported, including:
- Resource extractors (miners, oil pumps, water extractors)
- Wall/floor holes (conveyor, pipe holes)
- Some roof pieces
- Signs and displays
- Beams and pillars
- Multi-step placement items

**Note:** These items are not permanently excluded. Support for additional building types is planned for future updates.

### Are there any known mod compatibility issues?

There appears to be a compatibility issue with **InfiniteNudge**. When InfiniteNudge is installed, holding Smart! modifier buttons does **not** prevent rotation when using the mouse wheel. A proper compatibility fix is being investigated.

**Workarounds:**
- Uninstall or disable InfiniteNudge, **or**
- Use `NumPad 8` / `NumPad 5` to adjust Smart! settings instead of the mouse wheel.

### Does Smart! work in multiplayer?
Multiplayer is not currently supported but is under active testing with partial success. Multiplayer support may be added in a future update.

### Is Smart! open source?
The source code for Smart! is not publicly available at this time. We plan to release the source code as open source once all planned phases (Phases 1-4) are complete and we are ready to accept community code contributions. Open sourcing the codebase is on the roadmap, but we want to ensure the mod is feature-complete and stable before making the code public and opening it up for contributions.

## 🤖 AI Disclosure

Smart! v24 represents a complete rebuild for Satisfactory 1.1 by Finalomega (lead developer). This version was developed with assistance from multiple AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Cerebras, accessed via Windsurf by Cognition. An MCP server provided the models with access to a specialized knowledge base containing Satisfactory Mod Loader (SML) documentation and Alex's original Smart! source code, giving the AI models Satisfactory modding expertise.

**Important Note:** No AI components are integrated into Smart!'s runtime code. The mod contains no AI dependencies, machine learning models, or AI decision-making systems. All game logic is implemented in traditional C++ code that runs entirely within Satisfactory's modding framework. AI tools were used only during development and documentation phases.

AI assistance was used for:
- Architecture design and code structure
- C++ implementation and debugging
- Performance analysis and optimization
- Enhanced Input system integration
- Documentation and technical research
- API migration to Satisfactory 1.1

All implementation decisions, testing, refinement, and creative direction by Finalomega. AI was used as a development tool, similar to how developers use IDEs, compilers, and debuggers. Final responsibility for all code quality, functionality, and maintenance remains with the human developer.

Original Smart! mod (v1-v21) was created by Alex through Satisfactory Early Access without AI assistance. Smart! v23 is a ground-up rebuild by Finalomega for Satisfactory 1.1, developed with AI assistance.
